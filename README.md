# Parlor Room - Majong Matchmaking

A rating-based matchmaking for bot and human-bot mahjong games

## Features

### Core Matchmaking

- **Multi-lobby Support**: All Bot (immediate 4-bot games) and General (mixed human/bot) lobbies
- **Rank Based Player Matching**: Rating-based matching with configurable tolerance based on OpenSkill.
- **Dynamic Wait Time Calculation**: Statistical analysis of historical wait times to mitigate human waits.
- **Bot Backfilling**: Automatic bot addition with rating compatibility

## ðŸ”§ API Reference

### Queue Request Format

```json
{
  "player_id": "player_123",
  "lobby_type": "General",
  "player_type": "Human",
  "rating": {
    "rating": 1500.0,
    "uncertainty": 350.0
  }
}
```

### Game Starting Event Format

When a lobby is full and a game is ready to start, the service publishes a `GameStarting` event with the following structure:

```jsonc
{
  "lobby_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "game_id": "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8",
  "players": [
    {
      "id": "player_123",
      "player_type": "Human",
      "rating": {
        "rating": 1500.0,
        "uncertainty": 350.0
      },
      "joined_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z"
    }
    // + 3 more players
  ],
  "rating_scenarios": {
    "scenarios": [
      {
        "player_id": "player_123",
        "rank": 1,
        "current_rating": {
          "rating": 1500.0,
          "uncertainty": 350.0
        },
        "predicted_rating": {
          "rating": 1532.5,
          "uncertainty": 320.0
        },
        "rating_delta": 32.5
      }
      // Precalculated rating placement scenarios (16 total)
    ],
    "player_ranges": [
      {
        "player_id": "player_123",
        "current_rating": {
          "rating": 1500.0,
          "uncertainty": 350.0
        },
        "best_case_rating": {
          "rating": 1532.5,
          "uncertainty": 320.0
        },
        "worst_case_rating": {
          "rating": 1468.2,
          "uncertainty": 320.0
        },
        "max_gain": 32.5,
        "max_loss": -31.8
      }
      // + 3 more player score overviews
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:55.123456Z"
}
```

### Player Left Lobby Event Format

When a player leaves a lobby (due to disconnect, quit, timeout, etc.), the service publishes a `PlayerLeftLobby` event:

```jsonc
{
  "lobby_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "player_id": "player_456",
  "reason": "Disconnect",
  "remaining_players": [
    {
      "id": "player_123",
      "player_type": "Human",
      "rating": {
        "rating": 1500.0,
        "uncertainty": 350.0
      },
      "joined_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z"
    }
    // + remaining players still in lobby
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:32:10.456789Z"
}
```

**Leave Reasons:**

- `Disconnect` - Player connection lost
- `UserQuit` - Player manually left
- `Timeout` - Player inactive too long
- `SystemError` - Internal system error
- `BotReplacement` - Bot was replaced by human player

### Event Publishing

The service publishes events to configured AMQP exchanges:

- `PlayerJoinedLobby`: When a player joins a lobby
- `PlayerLeftLobby`: When a player leaves
- `GameStarting`: When a lobby is full and game begins
